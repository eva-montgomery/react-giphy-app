## Creating a React Giphy App with axios

- https://developers.giphy.com/


- To Do: 

- In GiphyApp.js
    - add a button 
    - when you click the button, it runs a helper function  
        - to begin with, just console.log()

    - some state
        - to begin with, just an empty array

    - update your helper function
        - it should add the string "hello" to the array

    - open the component inspector
    - make sure that the state array should get another "hello" string added to it every time you click the button
